      "abstract": "The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic-weight AMMs (aka Temporal Function Market Makers, TFMMs) implement algorithmic asset allocation, analogous to index or smart beta funds, by continuously updating pools' weights. A strategy updates target weights over time, and arbitrageurs trade the pool back toward those weights. This creates a sequence of small, predictable mispricings that grow until taken, effectively executing rebalances as a series of Dutch reverse auctions. Prior theoretical and simulation work (Willetts &amp; Harrington, 2024) predicted that this mechanism could outperform CEX-style rebalancing. We test that claim on two live pools on the QuantAMM protocol, one on Ethereum mainnet and one on Base, across two short rebalancing windows six months apart (July 2025 and January 2026). We perform block-level arbitrage analysis, and then measure long term outcomes using Loss-vs-Rebalancing (LVR) and Rebalancing-vs-Rebalancing (RVR) benchmarks. On mainnet, rebalancing becomes markedly more efficient over time (more frequent arbitrage trades with lower value extracted per trade), reaching performance comparable to or better than CEX-based models. On Base, rebalancing persists even when per-trade extraction is near (or below) zero, consistent with routing-driven execution, and achieves efficiencies that meet or exceed standard \"perfect rebalancing\" LVR baselines. These results demonstrate dynamic-weight AMMs as a competitive execution layer for tokenised funds, with superior performance on L2s where routing and lower data costs compress arbitrage spreads.",

      "abstract": "Networks underpin systems that range from finance to biology, yet their structure is often only partially observed. Current reconstruction methods typically fit the parameters of a model anew to each snapshot, thus offering no guidance to predict future configurations. Here, we develop a Bayesian approach that uses the information about past network snapshots to inform a prior and predict the subsequent ones, while quantifying uncertainty. Instantiated with a single-parameter fitness model, our method infers link probabilities from node strengths and carries information forward in time. When applied to the Electronic Market for Interbank Deposit across the years 1999-2012, our method accurately recovers the number of connections per bank at subsequent times, outperforming probabilistic benchmarks designed for analogous, link prediction tasks. Notably, each predicted snapshot serves as a reliable prior for the next one, thus enabling self-sustained, out-of-sample reconstruction of evolving networks with a minimal amount of additional data.",

      "abstract": "Parametric Portfolio Policies (PPP) estimate optimal portfolio weights directly as functions of observable signals by maximizing expected utility, bypassing the need to model asset returns and covariances. However, PPP ignores policy risk. We show that this is consequential, leading to an overstatement of expected utility and an understatement of portfolio risk. We develop Bayesian Parametric Portfolio Policies (BPPP), which place a prior on policy coefficients thereby correcting the decision rule. We derive a general result showing that the utility gap between PPP and BPPP is strictly positive and proportional to posterior parameter uncertainty and signal magnitude. Under a mean--variance approximation, this correction appears as an additional estimation-risk term in portfolio variance, implying that PPP overexposes when signals are strongest and when risk aversion is high. Empirically, in a high-dimensional setting with 242 signals and six factors over 1973--2023, BPPP delivers higher Sharpe ratios, substantially lower turnover, larger investor welfare, and lower tail risk, with advantages that increase monotonically in risk aversion and are strongest during crisis episodes.",

The value function and the optimal strategy can be characterized in terms of three systems of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with infinite horizon. One of them is a system of linear BSDEs with unbounded coefficients and infinite horizon, which seems to be new in literature. We establish the existence of the solutions to these BSDEs by BMO analysis and comparison theorem for multi-dimensional BSDEs. Next, we establish that the optimal control problem is well posed, in the sense that the value function is finite and the optimal strategy-when it exists-is unique. This is achieved by reformulating the cost functional as the sum of a quadratic functional and the candidate value function. The reformulation crucially relies on the well-established well-posedness results for systems of BSDEs. Finally, under additional assumptions, we obtain the unique optimal strategy.",

If P = NP, firms can efficiently solve the collusion detection problem, identifying deviations from cooperative agreements in complex, noisy markets and thereby making collusion sustainable as an equilibrium. If P != NP, the collusion detection problem is computationally infeasible for markets satisfying a natural instance-hardness condition on their demand structure, rendering punishment threats non-credible and collusion unstable. Combined with Maymin (2011), who proved that market efficiency requires P = NP, this yields a fundamental impossibility: markets can be informationally efficient or competitive, but not both. Artificial intelligence, by expanding firms' computational capabilities, is pushing markets from the competitive regime toward the collusive regime, explaining the empirical emergence of algorithmic collusion without explicit coordination.",

Extending the diffusion-based approach of Hamdouche, Henry-Labordère, Pham, 2023, we introduce a jump-diffusion Schrödinger bridge model that allows for discontinuities in the generative dynamics. Starting from a Schrödinger bridge entropy minimization problem, we reformulate the task as a stochastic control problem whose solution characterizes the optimal controlled jump-diffusion process. When sampled on a fixed time grid, this process generates synthetic time series matching the joint distributions of the observed data. The model is fully data-driven, as both the drift and the jump intensity are learned directly from the data. We propose practical algorithms for training, sampling, and hyperparameter calibration. Numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets, including financial and energy time series, show that incorporating jumps substantially improves the realism of the generated data, in particular by capturing abrupt movements, heavy tails, and regime changes that diffusion-only models fail to reproduce. Comparisons with state-of-the-art generative models highlight the benefits and limitations of the proposed approach.",
